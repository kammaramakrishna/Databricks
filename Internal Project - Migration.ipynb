    "If the files doesn't have Json parser(withjson in Databricks) it executes perfectly\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Written a Framework such a way that it will list the all the dependencies and weight\n",

    "Data Quality Checks:\n",

    "2. In snowflake it takes 15mins to execute the code\n",
    "   but in Databricks it takes 3hrs to execute (because SQL code is not optimized way written)\n",
    "   Multiple Ctes with more no of joins. which causes cte execute very slow\n",

    "Cost Issues:\n",
